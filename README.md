# Clocklands

An alternative to [tzinfo](https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo).

I've often been told that '_timezones are hard_', so, taking some inspiration from '[The Good Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Place)', I'm trying to make them easier with this Gem.



This may not be serious. Or even helpful.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'clocklands'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install clocklands

## Usage

As per [tzinfo](https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo)!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
